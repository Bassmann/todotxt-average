# todotxt-average
Todotxt plugin to calculate average task duration

It requires python3.

It will append to a file `average-report.txt` in the same directory as the `done.txt` file and add the date, the overall amount of done tasks and their average as well as the numbers for the last x days with 7 days as a default.

It looks like this

```
